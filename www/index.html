<h1>BTrace</h1>

<p>
BTrace is a safe, dynamic tracing tool for the Java platform. BTrace can be used to dynamically trace a running 
Java program (similar to <b><a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/dtrace/">DTrace for OpenSolaris</a></b>
applications  and OS).  BTrace dynamically instruments the classes of the target application to inject tracing code 
("bytecode tracing").  Tracing code is expressed in Java programming language. There is also integration with  
DTrace for the OpenSolaris platform. 
</p>
<p>There will be a <b><a href="https://visualvm.dev.java.net">VisualVM</a></b>
plugin for BTrace soon - so that the users can trace their application from the VisualVM client. Alternatively, 
if you'd prefer you can run BTrace from command line shells as well.
</p>
<p>
There is also a <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">NetBeans</a> plugin that makes it easier to write and deploy BTrace scripts. You can get it <a href="http://plugins.netbeans.org/PluginPortal/faces/PluginDetailPage.jsp?pluginid=10920">here</a>.

<h2>Building from the sources</h2>

BTrace sources are available from <a href="https://btrace.dev.java.net/source/browse/btrace/">CVS</a> repository.
After checking out the sources, you can use <b><a href="http://www.netbeans.org">NetBeans</a></b> to build
BTrace using the <a href="howtonetbeans.html">NetBeans project setup instructions</a>. There is also a <b><a href="https://btrace.dev.java.net/source/browse/btrace/docs/developersguide.html?rev=1.2">BTrace Developer's Guide</a></b>.

<h2>Known issues</h2>

<ul>

<li><b>JVM crash</b>: We have seen JVM crashes with BTrace. We have fixed few such 
crashes as well. JVM could crash due to the following reasons: 
<ol>
<li>BTrace submits invalid .class file to VM (bug in BTrace instrumentor)
<li>Hotswap bug in HotSpot JVM. 
</ol>
To enable debugging such scenarios, please turn on the following options in $BTRACE/bin/btrace (or btrace.bat) 
script. By default, the System properties <code>com.sun.btrace.debug</code> amd <code>com.sun.btrace.dumpClasses</code> are set to false in the scripts. Please change these to true. Also, you 
may want to add <code>-verify:all</code> option as well - which will force bytecode verification of all loaded classes. When you report a JVM crash with BTrace, please attach/send the following:
<ol>
<li>BTrace trace class that caused the crash.
<li>hs_err_pidXXX log produced by JVM.
<li>.class file(s) saved by BTrace setting the <code>com.sun.btrace.dumpClasses</code> option.
<li>debug output from BTrace by setting the <code>com.sun.btrace.debug</code> option.
</ol>
</ul>
