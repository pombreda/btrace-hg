In order to build this plugin you will need VisualVM 1.0.1 (or later) platform.
You can get it from https://visualvm.dev.java.net/download.html

Once you have it downloaded and unpacked on your harddrive you will need to
add it as a platform in the NetBeans:
1. Select "Tools/NetBeans Platforms" menu
2. Click the "Add Platform..." button
3. Navigate to the folder you extracted the visualvm application to and confirm the selection

After the platform has been registered you need to update the plugin to use it:
1. Right click the "VisualVM BTrace Plugin" project and select "Properties"
2. In the "Libraries" category use the "NetBeans Platform" combo to select the newly
   registered VisualVM platform

Now you are ready to perform "Clean And Build All" on the "VisualVM BTrace Plugin" project
